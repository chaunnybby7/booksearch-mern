## Description
```
This is a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, 
and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. 
The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, 
and Node.js/Express.js server and API. 
It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end. 

  
```
## Demo

After signing up an account, user stays logged in.
